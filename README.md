# CSCB58 Team 8 Project

A multiplayer game where 2 characters dressed as cowboys appear on the screen for a duel to be the ultimate cowboy of the midwest. Each player has a gun and must try to shoot the other player. This project is inspired by the game gunfight (AKA western gun) which was the worldâ€™s first game to depict human-to-human combat, and the first video game to use a microprocessor.
